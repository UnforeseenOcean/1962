### INSTRUCTIONS.md

The file you are reading now. It explains the project and how to participate. This file follows the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax.

### CONTRIBUTORS

List of the contributors to the project. To write / edit this file, see *Syntax*.

### PIECE

Source code of the physical sculpture 1962. In this file are depicted and documented all the objects which constitute a sculpture version and all the informations about the sculpture version itself.

### /media

Folder containing images of the current state of the piece and archives of past versions. This folder must be updated at least with photographs of the sculpture for each versions.

In /media, documents must be named using the tag of the last commit. For example: 0.jpg will be a photograph of the version 0 of 1962 ; 2_5.ogg can be a video capture of the version 2.5 of 1962…

A /media/HD (optional) subfolder can contain high-definition documents. This folder will be used to make media loading easier on a project web page. In this folder, documents must be named using the tag of the last commit + "HD". For example: 0_3HD.jpg.

### /extra

Folder (optional). It can be used as an addenda, an annexe or the archive of complementary documents such as process pictures, drawings films…

## Syntax

1962's files CONTRIBUTORS and PIECE follow a couple of simple syntaxic rules:

### Basics

- Use the format "Key: value"
- Parenthood relationship are symbolised using indentation (hit [tab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_character) key at the begining of a line). Demonstration:

        Name: Floral foam brick
        Size
            Width: 22,5cm
            Height: 10,6cm
            Depth: 8cm

- A line can't stay empty
- A line must begin with a capital letter
- A line can contain a title or a couple "key: value"

### Main informations

Details to understand the PIECE file:

    *     = Required informations
    //    = Comments
    Text: = Needs a value
    Text  = Is a title

### Evolutions of this INSTRUCTIONS file

This INSTRUCTIONS file can and must envolve. I should be modified in order to accompany the PIECE file. For example if a new kind of object needs the creation of a new kind of key (property), it needs to be archived below:

#### Mode

Electric or mechanical hardware can have one or multiple status, in this case a key "Mode" will be specified with values such as "On", "Off", "Blink"…

    Mode: On

#### Nutrients

Plant or animals needs water or food to live, a key "Additional water" or "Additional food" can be created, with scalable values such as units "|". Exemple for four water additions:

    Additional water: ||||

#### Circular objects

It should have a "Diameter" instead of a "Width".

#### Object origins

Default object origins are usually defined by object's closest angle to the main origin at the moment of its first represtentation on the sculpture. It can be confusing for some objects, in this case, it is better to precise the object origin in the "Position description" key:

    Position description: Vertical, origin is the bottom center of the stick

#### Models

An object can be considered as a copy of another model object. It will inherit by default of the keys and values of its model. Models will be quoted with, as a key: "Model" and as a value: the model object's ID. In the following example, the object (ID=6) will inherit the size and Y and Z positions of its model (ID=5).

    ID: 5
        Name: Credit card
        Size
            Width: 8,5cm
            Height: 5,5cm
            Depth: 0.1cm
        Position
            X position: 3cm
            Y position: 3cm
            Z position: 0cm
    ID: 6
        Model: ID=5
        Possition
            X position: 10cm

If an object is relative to a model from a previous sculpture version, the version number should be added before the model's ID separated by a slash:

    ID: 6
        Model: v0.7 / ID=5
        Possition
            X position: 10cm
